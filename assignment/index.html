    <p>To review: question 6, 7, and 8, 9! For Loop, For of Loop, and While Loop</p>
    <p>To review: While Loop</p>
    <p>To review: let vs const</p>
    <p>Note: for in loops over enumerable property names of an object</p>
    <p>Note: for of (new in ES6) does use an object-specific iterator and loops over the values generated by that</p>
    <p>Note: For Loop (use indexing) and For of Loop does not. For Loop question #6: define a const var within {} statement to represent arr[]</p>
    <p>Comment: number 8 and 9 was a challange!!</p>
